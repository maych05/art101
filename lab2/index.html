				<h2> Hello world!</h2>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Something that was difficult for me was getting the format to load. At first, the code for my decoration did not work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The website worked very well! I enjoyed spending time with my partner and I think it looks really cool. I understood CSS and HTML code better after this assignment.</p>

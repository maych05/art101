			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocode and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a simple pseudocode computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, I wasn't sure how to format my code. Using Wes's format as I guide, I structed my code like his and it started working for me.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The assignment was a lot of fun! My partner and I came up with a game that I didn't know, but she did. It was really cool to see how coding can be as simple as just writing pseudocode to make a game. This assignment was really easy so I feel like I did not put a lot of effort in it. </p>

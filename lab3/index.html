					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge is to create a homepage, link all your labs in the Lab 3 page, and upload your website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that I had was that my images would not change in my CSS site. I found out that it was actually my homepage css that controlled my image size.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>At first, I had a lot of trouble with my website. My lab 2 format got deleted for some reason, my images wouldn't load, and I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong. After working with my partner, Alexander, I got the help I need to work through what I did not understand. Eventually, I got it to work and it was actaully pretty easy and fun! </p>
